# Text Classifier Android example
The app uses `Tensorflow lite` text model to analyse movie review & categorize them in either positve or negative sentiments.

Sentiment analysis is the interpretation and classification of emotions (positive, negative and neutral) within text data using text analysis techniques.

This project shows how to build a machine learning model for sentiment analysis, in particular classifying text as positive or negative. This is an example of binary—or two-class—classification, an important and widely applicable kind of machine learning problem.
